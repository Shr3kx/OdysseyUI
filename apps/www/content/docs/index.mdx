title: Introduction
description: A design focused component library for Next.js, built for speed, flexibility and developer experience .
---

**Odyssey UI is a design first UI library** built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), based on the shadcn registry and inspired by [odysseyui](https://odysseyui.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Our goal is simple; components that work immediately, code you can play with, rebuild as you see fit.

## What makes Odyssey UI different

- **You own the code** — Install components directly into your codebase. No version conflicts, no dependency hell, no upstream breaking changes.
- **The boring stuff, done well** — Grids that behave, forms that submit, navigation that makes sense. Animation that breathes.
- **Batteries included, wires exposed** — Sensible defaults that work immediately, with full access to modify internals when you need to.

## What’s included

1. **Zero lock-in** — Every component lives in your repo. Fork it, break it, rebuild it.
2. **Next.js optimized** — Server Components by default, Client Components only where necessary. App Router native.
3. **Tailwind v4 ready** — Built on the latest Tailwind with CSS-first configuration and container query support.
4. **Performance by default** — No runtime CSS-in-JS, minimal client-side JavaScript, tree-shakeable exports.
5. **Documentation that ships** — Powered by Fumadocs—fuzzy search, ready-made templates, component showcases, and full MDX support, right out of the box.

## Credits

Odyssey UI stands on the shoulders of exceptional open source work:
