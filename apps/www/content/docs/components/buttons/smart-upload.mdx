## Installation

<ComponentInstallation name="components-buttons-smart-upload" />

<Callout>
  **Note:** This component uses **Framer Motion** for layout transitions and
  animated states. It is inspired by
  [shoryacodes](https://shoryacodes.vercel.app/)
</Callout>

## Usage

```tsx
import SmartUpload from '@/components/odysseyui/smart-upload';

export default function Page() {
  return <SmartUpload />;
}
```

## How It Works

- Uses a finite visual state system:
  - `idle`
  - `scanning`
  - `encrypting`
  - `uploading`
  - `done`
- Automatically sequences states using timed transitions.
- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` to generate a live preview.
- Uses `motion.div` with `layout` for smooth container resizing.
- Includes animated overlays for:
  - Scanning beam
  - Encryption grid pulses
  - Upload progress fill
- Automatically resets back to `idle` after completion.

## Animation Flow

1. User selects a file.
2. Preview renders.
3. Virus Scan animation plays.
4. Encryption grid overlay animates.
5. Upload progress fills.
6. Completion state appears.
7. Component resets.
